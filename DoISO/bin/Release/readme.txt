Introduction
------------

DoISO is a simple ISO creation frontend for mkisofs, the ultimate ISO creating utility.  One day I wanted to make a DVD-sized ISO but found that my previously trusty ISO utilities would only go to CD size.  mkisofs was the only utility available, and it required reading the manual every time I wanted to make a quick ISO, so in reality there was no such thing as making a quick ISO :(.  I decided enough was enough, I had to have a reliable GUI for making any size ISO that I wanted, so I went back to some old commandline wrapping code I had used in another project (Mike Mayer's process launch code) and simply wrapped mkisofs.

DoISO was born, and I was happy because I could make quick, easy ISO's :).

Enjoy.
